# Benchmark building notes

To compile the benchmark with the latest EMBOSS package, first download
and extract the package into some directory, then copy the "benchmark.c"
file to "emboss/" subdirectory, and the benchmark.acd file to the
"emboss/acd/" subdirectory.

To make the "make" command build the benchmark tool, edit
"emboss/Makefile.am" file:

 * add "benchmark" to the "bin_PROGRAMS" variable,

 * add line "benchmark_SOURCES = benchmark.c" line, close to where other
   "*_SOURCES" variables are defined.

 * go back to root EMBOSS-vvv directory, and run the following sequence
   to recreate emboss/Makefile.in:

     aclocal -I m4
     autoconf
     automake -a

Then run "./configure" and "make".

Benchmark tool is then run as:

  benchmark gff::path_to_file.gff3
